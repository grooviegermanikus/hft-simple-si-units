## What is this?
* attempt model price + size for trading domain using the same approach as simple-si-units ([GitHub](https://github.com/DrPlantabyte/simple-si-units))
* adoptions of simple-si-units's macros (e.g. _mul_unit!_) to support more custom mul/div implementations

## Where to start?
* look at test _hft.rs_ -> _size_and_price_
* look into _src/notional.rs_
